Arduino Differential Drive Robot Boilerplate
Design and build an autonomous OOP-controlled differential drive mechatronic prototype for transportation within an industrial storage warehouse. Your system's core functions are to follow a black line and avoid objects. It should also provide a basic UI that informs observers of its current state. The test track will be provided to you.
