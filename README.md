# Arduino Manipulator Robot Boilerplate
Design and build an autonomous OOP-controlled manipulator mechatronics prototype for an industrial assembly line. The core function of your system is to use an end effector to pick and sort 25x25x25mm coloured cubes. You can choose between 3 to 6 'degrees of freedom' and design the pick-and-sort zones to suit your system. Your mechatronic system must be able to sort at least two coloured (black, white, blue, green, or red) cubes, which will be provided to you.

## Core Components
1. Up to 6x 270°/180° RDS3115mg/DS3115mg Servo Motors
2. Arduino Uno R4 Wfi

5. Robot Clamp Gripper
6. Servo Brackets
7. Rotating head base
8. Dupont Cables
9. 2x 3.7v 18650 Polymer Lithium Ion Battery
10. 2x LiPo holder
11. XL4015 DC to DC Converter Module (alternative to use Diodes in series)
12. 5x20 PCB Fuse holder 
13. 5x20 fuse
14. 100µF 25v capacitor for each servo
15. 100nf ceramic capacitor for each servo
